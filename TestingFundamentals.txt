Testing is a process, not an activity

Plan  - TestPlan
Startegy - TestStartegy
define - TestCases - you set expected data
execute - manually check test cases or automate the testcases - actual data
analyze - Reports will be analyzed

Unit Testing
Integration Testing
Acceptance Testing


Requirement:
It should switch on - when user clicks power button
It should allow user to install softwares
It should restart and shutdown as per user selection

verification :
Testing whether product is as per the requirement.

are we building the product right?

whitebox testing - mostly done by developers

Hp company - laptop



validation :
Testing in terms of end user or client persepective.

Are we building a right product?

black box testing - done by testing team

Functionality + security + performance - load testing, stress testing, compatibility

Is it same time when he try to switch on and off several times
Is it supporting to install any software
Is the user able secure his system - credentials setup


Testcases should not be exhaustive but they should be efficient
Think about planning each testcase in a unique way- this improves test coverage

Test cases:
valid data
Invalid data
Boundary Values
Security


dataOfJourney - >= todays date

Requirement:
Srs documents/ User stories in Rally


Search Box:

It should be text box where user can enter search field
Once he click on search button user should see search results page.
In search results page- he should see all products as per the search keyword
Further navigation on click of any product should take to details page.

Few things before raising defect:

debug the cause of issue

Issue could be at deployment level - contact build/deployment team- ask them redeploy, try deploying
the previous build
Issue could be at DataBase level (dev, qa, live)- data issue - DB team
Issue could be at API level - right click, inspect the browser- opens dev tools, observe- network, console
Check server logs(application logs) by connecting to unix
Issue at Developer level - Raise the defect -

TestLifeCycle:

WhiteboxTesting : Testing the requirement by having knowledge on the implemented code
BlackboxTesting : Tsting the rquirement without any knwoledge on how code is implemented.
GreyBoxTesting : having partial knowledge on the code and testing it.


Test Levels:
UnitTesting - developers  write unit testcases /whitebox testing
IntegrationTesting - done by developer in dev env and tester in test env
SystemTesting- done by tester
UserAcceptanceTesting-- done by tester

int add(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}
int sub(int a, int b){
return a-b;
}
int mul(int a, int b){

}
int div(int a, int b){
return a/b;

}

int addTest3(){
result = Calculator.add(-5,-6);//actual result
if(expected==actual){
print(test passed)
}
}

}

System Testing
Types Of Testing:

Functionality
Performance:
Stress test - find breaking point 
load test- send concurrent user requests and observer response time- entire time taken to get response, 
latency-time traken to get first byte of response, throughput - no of requests servred in given time
good performance- throughput should be high , latency & response time should be low
volume test - database level - query performance  w.r.to 10 users or 1000 users is same or not
Usability- menus, dropdowns, paginations, breadcrumbs, infinite scrolling, ajax elemnts, check boxes, radio buttons, links...
Security- Application should prevent hacking techniques:
Authentication:
login credentials
One time password
captcha images:
6vXyz
click on all the street signs

Authorisation - role based permissions
SQL Injection
CrossSiteScripting
DDOS

//logic to register with amazon by changing user id or mail dynamically
//logic to login with amazon 
}

Accessibility : ADA COMPLIANCE , text to speech, html modern tags..

Localization :

internationalization:

Usability: look and feel
clicks, scrolling, page navigations, font size, font color
images, infinite scrolling, buttons, text boxes, tables, dropdowns,

Compatibility:

browsers - mozilla, chrome, ie, safari
operating systems- windows, mac, linux/unix

configuration

installation


*******************

Regression Testing : Testing the already tested software whenever a defect fix or 
enhancement occurs.

Make sure that defect/enhancement did not break already working software.


Retesting: Testig the defect fix

*******

Smoke test cases - priority  or mandatory test cases 
Functional Test cases - all the possible test cases for given requirement
Regression Test cases - important functionality test cases

kayak.com- smoke, functional, regression test cases

SmokeTestCases:

***
uat - Test from end user perspective and people who represent end client do user acceptance testing.

alpha testing - Releasing the product within the company(microsoft release new windows version within their employers) and
take feedback from team to correct  any issues.
beta testing - Releasing the product to end users and take feedback from end users to correct any issues.


Blackbox testing techniques:
EquivalencePartitioning - 

User registration:

registration date

2-9-2017

Invalid - < todays date - 2-3  invalid 
valid - > todays date - 2-3 valid
= todays date

10 users  per booking
min 1 user

valid - 1-10 - valid - 2,3,5
invalid - <1 and >10 - invalid - 11,12,0

BoundaryValue Analysis -
testing the ranges at exact limit points
1-10 - valid
<1, >10- invalid

=1 and =10



Decision making graph-

10% discount for users who registers in feb month

prime users - 12%

valuable customers - 15%
